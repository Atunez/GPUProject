TODO: 
------------

1) Implement simple sequential encode and decode
2) create skeleton for parralel decode, Algo 1. 
	- takes as input set of compressed bit vectors, Cols (only needed vectors for range query)
	- use 64 bit words, WAH encoded
	- LAUNCHES KERNEL decomp (algo 2, described next)
3) create skeleton for decomp used by decode, Algo 2.
	- takes as input single compressed WAH vector, CData
	- takes as input size of the WAH vector, CSize (number of 64 bit words CData represents)
	- takes as input size of decompressed data, DSize (number of 64 bit words in original data)
	- creates DecompSize array, (same size as CData)
	* each thread manages one atom of compressed data (one WAH 64 bit word)
	* optimal block size = (1024 x 1 x 1) 
	*
